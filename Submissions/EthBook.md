## Open Source repo
https://github.com/jschiarizzi/ethbookOS

## Installation 
Use our bootable image to install a new operating system following the ChromiumOS quick start guide: https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/quick-start-guide. It was too large to upload to github with sketchy wifi, but we have it on a USB.

To use *just* our gnosis chrome-app wrapper, check out the .CRX files in our github repo. You can add them to ~/chrome/browser/resources/default_apps to use them on any ChromiumOS based machne.
